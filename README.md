## Welcome // Bienvenid@.

Hi! This is just another random profile made for academic purposes.

Don't take anything i say / said / will say seriously; my head is a maze and i can't figure it out at all.

WARNING! --> EXTREMELY AUTISTIC

### [&#x200B;](#)Here's some info about (me):

* Developer Wannabe, mostly interested in `python` and `java` / `javascript` (though i'll put up with whatever)
* Currently looking into modding stuff and frame data.
* I speak both English and Spanish fluently.
* I hate the antichrist.

## Hobbies (duh):

* I enjoy music a lot, mostly interested in alt metal and shoegaze. I also listen to OSTs from time to time.
* Souls games PvP (i suck tho) / I have over 1K Hours into Elden Ring and i can't strafe a damn halberd :D
* Just hanging out with anyone who i consider a friend, i have no enemies.
